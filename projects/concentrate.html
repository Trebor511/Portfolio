        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Concentrate!</strong> is a retro arcade-style game inspired by the classic 
            <em>Tapper!</em> and built entirely without a traditional game engine. Developed using the 
            <strong>Vulkan graphics API</strong> and the <strong>FLECS Entity-Component-System (ECS) framework</strong>, 
            this project focuses on low-level rendering, manual memory management, and custom gameplay architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game reimagines the original Tapper gameplay into a more family-friendly experience—replacing beer 
            with orange juice—while maintaining the rapid, timing-based action of the arcade classic. Sprite 
            rendering, input handling, physics behaviors, entity updates, and core game loop logic were all 
            implemented from the ground up, providing a hands-on understanding of real-time rendering and ECS-driven 
            gameplay.

        <h2>Technical Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Vulkan Rendering Pipeline:</strong> Implemented low-level rendering, swapchain setup, 
                vertex buffers, texture sampling, and synchronization primitives.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>FLECS ECS Architecture:</strong> Designed entities and components for players, drinks, 
                patrons, and game systems, enabling efficient updates and behavior separation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Custom Sprite System:</strong> Built a 2D sprite renderer on top of Vulkan's 
                command-buffer architecture for fast and efficient rendering.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Game Logic & Input Handling:</strong> Implemented movement, drink-serving behavior, 
                patron AI, scoring, and failure states from scratch.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Level Structure & Timing Systems:</strong> Built a complete gameplay loop including 
                difficulty escalation, spawn timing, and resource management.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Development Notes</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Concentrate!</strong> built directly on top of my previous <em>Level Renderer</em> project, 
            extending the rendering foundation into a fully playable game. Working with Vulkan and FLECS provided 
            a deep understanding of graphics pipelines, memory handling, and data-oriented architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project reinforced advanced skills in:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Low-level rendering APIs (Vulkan)</li>
            <li>ECS-based engine architecture</li>
            <li>Real-time update loops & performance optimization</li>
            <li>Input systems & game mechanic scripting</li>
            <li>Memory management and GPU/CPU synchronization</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Together, these systems represent a complete custom-built game framework—with no Unity, Unreal, or 
            traditional engine tools involved.
