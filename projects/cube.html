        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Rotating Cube</strong> is a computer graphics project developed in C++
            as part of Full Sail University’s graphics programming curriculum.
            The assignment began with implementing foundational line-drawing algorithms and
            gradually expanded into rendering a fully 3D cube, applying rotation
            transformations, and projecting it into 2D space using perspective mathematics.
        </p>

        <p>
            The final result is a smooth, real-time animated cube rendered with custom graphics logic.
            No game engine required, only low-level math,
            transformation matrices, and manual pixel plotting.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Line Drawing Algorithms:</strong> Implemented foundational rendering logic,
                including digital differential analyzer (DDA) and Bresenham-style approaches.</li>

            <li><strong>3D Cube Geometry:</strong> Defined cube vertices, edges, and connectivity
                manually in 3D space.</li>

            <li><strong>Rotation Transformations:</strong> Applied rotation matrices to animate
                the cube around multiple axes.</li>

            <li><strong>Perspective Projection:</strong> Used projection math to convert 3D points
                into 2D screen coordinates for a realistic depth effect.</li>

            <li><strong>Frame Rendering Loop:</strong> Built a continuous update-draw pipeline
                for smooth animation and real-time performance.</li>

            <li><strong>CMake Project Structure:</strong> Fully configured cross-platform
                CMake setup for building and compiling the application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
        <p>
            This project emphasized understanding the mathematical foundations of 3D graphics.
            All rotations, projections, and rendering behavior were implemented manually using
            vector math and transformation matrices—without relying on graphics APIs.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cube is rendered using per-frame updates that apply incremental rotations,
            followed by projecting the transformed vertices and drawing the connecting edges.
            This workflow demonstrates strong fundamentals in graphics programming,
            linear algebra, coordinate space transformations, and low-level rendering logic.
