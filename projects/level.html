        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This <strong>Level Renderer</strong> is a C++ graphics programming project built as an extension
            of my Rotating Cube renderer. The goal was to evolve the renderer into a fully functional 
            <strong>real-time level loader</strong> capable of importing custom scene data, reading object 
            transforms, and rendering multiple 3D models efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system uses a <strong>custom text-based level description format</strong>, allowing objects to be positioned,
            rotated, and loaded dynamically at runtime. Levels were designed in Blender, then exported through a 
            purpose-built script that extracted transform data, enabling accurate scene reconstruction inside the engine.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Custom Level File Parser:</strong> Reads model filenames, positional data, and orientation values 
                from a text-based format to generate the level dynamically at runtime.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Model Loading with h2bParser:</strong> Integrated the <code>h2bParser</code> to load and manage 
                mesh data from exported <code>.h2b</code> files, improving efficiency and runtime performance.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Blender-to-Engine Workflow:</strong> Designed levels directly inside Blender, exporting transform 
                data to ensure accurate placement, rotation, and scaling inside the renderer.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Object-Oriented Architecture:</strong> Implemented a robust system for managing multiple models, 
                improving readability and enabling scalable scene construction.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>3D Transformations:</strong> Applied translation, rotation, and scaling matrices using Gateware’s 
                math libraries to position objects correctly in world space.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Breakdown</h2>
        <p>
            The renderer is built on top of <strong>Gateware</strong>, which provides low-level access to system 
            hardware, math utilities, and windowing functionality. On top of this foundation, I implemented:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Scene generation through iterative parsing of level files</li>
            <li>Matrix transformation pipelines for world, view, and projection spaces</li>
            <li>A structured system for storing and rendering multiple mesh instances</li>
            <li>Optimized batching and model management for real-time performance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project significantly strengthened my understanding of <strong>graphics programming, file I/O, 
            3D mathematics, engine architecture, and real-time rendering workflows</strong>.
