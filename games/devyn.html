    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Devyn in Space</strong> is a first-person wave-based shooter developed in Unity 2022
        as a six-person group project. The game features multiple combat arenas, a complete weapon
        and upgrade system, varied enemy behaviors, and boss encounters designed to challenge the
        player across progressive waves.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project was scoped and completed as a fully playable experience, including four unique
        weapons, four standard enemy types, two boss fights, and an in-game shop system that allows
        players to upgrade stats and acquire new weapons between waves. The game emphasizes clear
        combat readability, escalating difficulty, and replay-focused systems.

            including progression, escalation rules, and wave completion conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Weapon System:</strong> A modular weapon framework supporting four
            distinct guns with different firing behaviors, ammo handling, and balance profiles.

    <h2>Team Structure & My Role</h2>
    <p>
        Devyn in Space was developed by a team of six. I served as the <strong>Lead Developer</strong>
        on the project, responsible for guiding technical decisions, organizing the overall structure
        of the codebase, and coordinating system implementation across the team.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to leadership responsibilities, I worked as a generalist gameplay programmer,
        contributing directly to the design and implementation of multiple core systems. This included
        both hands-on programming and mentoring teammates to ensure features were completed, integrated,
        and stable.
    </p>

    <h2>Enemy Design & Behavior</h2>
    <p>
        A significant portion of my development time was focused on designing and implementing
        enemy behaviors that felt distinct and readable during high-action combat scenarios.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Melee Enemies:</strong> Close-range attackers designed to pressure the
            player’s positioning and movement.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Juggernauts:</strong> High-health enemies that absorb damage and force
            prioritization during intense waves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Swarm Enemies:</strong> Small, fast attackers intended to overwhelm the player
            through numbers rather than raw strength.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ranged Enemies:</strong> Distance-based attackers that introduce positional
            threats and encourage spatial awareness.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="project-section">
    <h2>Level Design & Environmental Systems</h2>
    <p>
        I was responsible for the level design of all four combat levels as well as both boss arenas.
        Each space was designed to support wave-based gameplay, emphasizing clear sightlines,
        player movement options, and combat flow.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Four fully designed combat levels</li>
        <li>Two dedicated boss arenas</li>
        <li>Ladder traversal system</li>
        <li>Damage and disappearing platform mechanics</li>
        <li>Pickups for health and weapons</li>
    </ul>
