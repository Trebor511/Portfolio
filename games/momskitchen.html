    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Mom's Kitchen</strong> is a single-player cooking and shop-management game currently in active
        development, built in Unreal Engine 5.6 with a C++-first architecture. The goal of the
        project is to create a flexible, system-driven simulation where players can grow a
        small kitchen into a fully customizable production space through cooking, gardening,
        crafting, and customer service mechanics.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project is designed with scalability in mind, focusing on clean class hierarchies,
        modular gameplay systems, and data-driven design that allows new content and mechanics
        to be added without refactoring existing systems. While Blueprints are used for UI
        and rapid iteration, all core gameplay logic is implemented in C++.
    </p>

<h2>Core Systems & Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Inventory System:</strong> A fully C++-driven inventory supporting stackable
            items, quality tiers, and extensible item data for future crafting and production.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Interactable Framework:</strong> A reusable interaction system built using
            interfaces, allowing tools, stations, and world objects to respond consistently
            to player input.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Workstation Architecture:</strong> A base workstation class that serves as
            the foundation for specialized stations such as brewing, chopping, cooking, and
            crafting, enabling shared logic with station-specific behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gardening & Production Loop:</strong> A complete seed-to-harvest pipeline
            where players plant crops, manage growth, harvest produce, and route materials
            into downstream cooking or crafting systems.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a solo development effort. I was responsible for all core gameplay
        programming, system architecture, and technical design decisions. This includes
        defining class hierarchies, implementing gameplay systems in C++, and maintaining
        clean separation between gameplay logic and UI.
    </p>

    <p>
        A strong emphasis was placed on writing reusable, maintainable code that could support
        long-term development, frequent iteration, and future expansion without introducing
        technical debt.
    </p>
