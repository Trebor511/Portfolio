    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
       <strong>Pixelcution</strong> is a fast-paced top-down action shooter developed in Unreal Engine 4.27 
            by a team of five, with myself acting as the lead developer. The game features a dynamic weapon system,
            multiple enemy archetypes, a procedurally generated dungeon, and a roguelite-inspired relic upgrade system.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the lead developer, I coordinated the technical direction, guided team members through feature 
            implementation, and contributed major gameplay systems—including movement, weapon design, enemy behaviors, 
            and level structure.

    <h2>Enemy Design & Behavior</h2>
    <p>
        A strong portion of the project relies on the enemy types. Having a variety of different enemy types was essential
        to the fun factor and success of the game. Some of these enemy types include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Swordsman Enemies:</strong> Close-range attackers designed to swarm the player, forcing
            reaction and positioning.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Magic Casters:</strong> Flying enemies that target the player with volleys of magic. These 
            enemies give verticality to targets, and absorb bullets with their projectiles, creating a new situation
            for the player to overcome
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Grenadiers:</strong> A deadly combination of the Swordsman and Magic Caster, this enemy type is mostly 
            stationary, hurling lethal bombs at the player. While these enemies deal a lot of damage, they can be dispatched 
            easier due to their stationary behavior, and their bombs can be shot out of the air. 
        </li>
    </ul>
