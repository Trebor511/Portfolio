    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
       <strong>Pixelcution</strong> is a fast-paced top-down action shooter developed in Unreal Engine 4.27 
            by a team of five, with myself acting as the lead developer. The game features a dynamic weapon system,
            multiple enemy archetypes, a procedurally generated dungeon, and a roguelite-inspired relic upgrade system.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the lead developer, I coordinated the technical direction, guided team members through feature 
            implementation, and contributed major gameplay systems—including movement, weapon design, enemy behaviors, 
            and level structure.
